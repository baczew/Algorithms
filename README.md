### Binary Search
One of the core Computer Science algorithms, created to check if an element can be found in an array.

**Steps:**
1. Sort the array.
2. Find the middle element of the array.
3. Compare the searched value with the middle element.
4. If searched value is greater, rerun the algorithm with the right side of the array, if lower rerun with the left side.
5. If the middle element is equal to the searched element, searched element exists in the array.
