### Binary Search
One of the core Computer Science algorithms, created to check if an element can be found in an array.

**Steps:**
1. Sort the array.
2. Find the middle element of the array.
3. Compare the searched value with the middle element.
4. If searched value is greater, rerun the algorithm with the right side of the array, if lower rerun with the left side.
5. If the middle element is equal to the searched element, searched element exists in the array.

### Sum of Medians

Example of an algorithm with a heap insert method implemented from scratch. 
It allows the program to keep the list sorted and that is essential part of calculating the median.
Sorting *input list* each time separately would make the program run much longer.
